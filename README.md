# Bootstrap-Portfolio

The objective of this assignment was to build two different portfolios; one using strictly Bootstrap and another without Bootstrap but also make the page responsive. 

## Difficulties
For the bootstrap assignment, I again was not able to excute the media queries to make the page responsive to different sized screens. Things sure were aligning correctly as I had hoped for. 

Again, this is a learning lesson for me put more time into learning about media queries and naming tags better to make my coding life better and easier. I will also have to learn to incorporate the use of grids so that the content, as the screen gets smaller, the content will stack ontop of one another. 

I will keep practicing and make sure to get help when needed for further clarification on how to do something.
